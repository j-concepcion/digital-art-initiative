            <h3>The Initative</h3>
            <p>This began as our personal catharsis: To voice out our anxieties and calm those who share the same
                sentiments. We began a design series that hoped to provide empathy and encouragement, but it also came with a question
                that lingered: What’s next?
                <br><br>
                Everyday we worry still. We think of the people who brave the outdoors to save lives. Those who worry about their jobs
                and livelihood. Those who continue to remain anxious about what tomorrows will look like as our cities are forced into hibernation.
                <br><br>
                We knew we had to do more.
                <br><br>
                It’s time our thoughts transformed into actions. We will be helping the best way we know how—with art and through art.
